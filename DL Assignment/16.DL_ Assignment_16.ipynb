    "**Ans**: \n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Sigmoid**: The sigmoid activation function is a type of mathematical function used in artificial neural networks that maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1. This allows the model to make predictions based on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Tanh:** The tanh activation function is similar to the sigmoid activation function, but it maps any real number to a value between -1 and 1. This allows the model to make more accurate predictions compared to the sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c) ReLU**: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is a type of activation function that takes any real number and outputs 0 if the number is less than 0, and the same number if it is greater than or equal to zero. This allows the model to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d) ELU**: The ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) activation function is a type of activation function that takes any real number and outputs a negative number if the number is less than 0, and the same number if it is greater than or equal to zero. This allows the model to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e) LeakyReLU**: The LeakyReLU activation function is similar to the ReLU activation function, but it outputs a small negative number if the input is less than 0. This helps to reduce the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where the activation function outputs 0 for all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f) Swish**: The swish activation function is a type of activation function that takes any real number and outputs a value in the range of -1 to 1. This allows the model to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions."

Conversely, when you decrease the optimizer learning rate, the optimizer is less likely to reach a local minimum and may take more time to find a suitable solution."

    "**Ans**: Regularization is used to avoid overfitting by adding constraints to the model parameters, such as weight decay or dropout. This forces the model to learn more generalizable patterns in the data, rather than fitting to the noise or outliers in the training data. Regularization also helps to prevent the model from overfitting by encouraging simpler models.\n",

Loss functions measure the difference between the predictions of the model and the ground truth labels, while cost functions are measures of how well the model is performing. Cost functions are typically a combination of the loss function and the regularization component."
