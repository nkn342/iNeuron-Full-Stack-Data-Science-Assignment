    "**Ans**: Matrix multiplication involves a large number of arithmetic operations, and performing those operations using the basic Python operations can be slow because Python is an interpreted language, which means that it has to interpret and execute each line of code at runtime. This can lead to a significant overhead when working with large matrices.\n",

They also offer various optimizations such as parallelism, vectorization, and caching, which further improve the performance of matrix multiplication.\n",

Specifically, element-wise arithmetic can be used to implement a faster version of matrix multiplication known as `“broadcasting matrix multiplication.”`\n",

By performing many element-wise operations in parallel, we can significantly reduce the time it takes to compute the result of a matrix multiplication.\n",
