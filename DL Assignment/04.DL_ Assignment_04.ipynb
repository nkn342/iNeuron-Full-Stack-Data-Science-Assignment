    "**Ans**: While TensorFlow includes a subset of NumPy's functionality, it is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy. NumPy is primarily focused on numerical computing and provides a powerful N-dimensional array object, while TensorFlow is focused on machine learning and provides operations on tensors, which are similar to NumPy's arrays but with additional features for building and training neural networks.\n",

    "**The main differences between NumPy and TensorFlow are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Computational Graphs**: TensorFlow uses a computational graph to represent operations, allowing for efficient distributed computing and automatic differentiation for backpropagation, while NumPy does not have this capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **GPU Acceleration**: TensorFlow supports GPU acceleration for neural network computations, which can significantly speed up training times compared to NumPy, which primarily uses the CPU.\n",
