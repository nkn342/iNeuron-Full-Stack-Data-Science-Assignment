    "**Ans**: Cyclical momentum is a concept in computer vision that refers to the idea of using momentum from a previously successful model to help guide the development of a new model. This can help to ensure that the new model is built on the successes of the past and also makes it easier to quickly iterate on and improve existing models. Cyclical momentum can help to speed up the development process and provide more accurate results."

This can lead to overfitting where the model only learns the data it is provided, and is not able to generalize to new data. This is a common problem in computer vision because of the large, complex datasets that are used to train these models."

    "**Ans**: Batch normalization layers help models generalize better by normalizing the activations of each layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps to reduce internal covariate shift, which is when the input to each layer changes as the weights of the model are updated. By normalizing the inputs to each layer, the internal covariate shift is reduced and the model is less sensitive to changes in the weights, leading to better generalization."
