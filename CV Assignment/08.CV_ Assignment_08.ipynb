    "InceptionNet is composed of modules called Inception Modules. Each Inception Module consists of a number of convolutional layers with different filter sizes and depths. This allows the network to learn different levels of abstractions from the input image. The input image is first convolved with a series of convolutional layers in the first Inception Module. This produces an output which is then passed through another set of convolutional layers in the second Inception Module. This process is repeated until the output of the last Inception Module is reached.\n",

It is composed of a series of convolutional layers and pooling layers, which are used to extract features from an image. The Inception block is designed to capture a large number of different features at different scales by using a combination of 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutional filters. It also uses a global average pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality of the features extracted. The Inception block is an important component of the GoogLeNet architecture, which won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2014."

    "**Ans**: Reducing the dimensionality of a network can have a number of positive impacts on performance. Dimensionality reduction can reduce the complexity of the network, which can reduce the computational overhead associated with training the network. By reducing the number of features that the network needs to process, the model can learn faster and more accurately. Additionally, dimensionality reduction can reduce overfitting, as it eliminates redundant features that may contribute to the model's memorization of the training data. Finally, it can also reduce the storage requirements for the network, as fewer features require less space"
