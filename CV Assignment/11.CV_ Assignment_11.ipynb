    "**Ans**: Region Proposals are a type of computer vision algorithm that are used to identify and extract potential regions of interest in an image or video. These regions are then used to segment the image or video into different areas of interest. The regions are generated through a combination of low-level image features, such as edges and color, as well as high-level semantic information. Region Proposals can be used to detect objects, faces, and text in images and videos."

    "**Ans**: Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is a computer vision technique used to reduce the number of detected objects in an image by removing redundant or overlapping detections. It works by comparing the maximum detection score at each location in the image and discarding any detections with a score below a certain threshold. NMS can help reduce false positives and improve accuracy in object detection tasks."

It is computed by averaging the precision of a model at different recall values, which represents the proportion of objects detected in the image. mAP can also be used to compare different models and determine which one is the most accurate."

It is commonly used to measure the frame rate achieved by a video camera, display, or other device. Computer vision applications often require high frame rates to capture and analyze events as they occur, so FPS is an important metric for measuring the performance of these systems."

It is the ratio of the area of overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box to the total area of the two bounding boxes. A higher IOU indicates a better match between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. This metric is commonly used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification."

It is a plot of the precision (positive predictive value) against the recall (sensitivity) of the model. The PR curve is used to measure the trade-off between a modelâ€™s precision and recall. The higher the precision and recall, the better the model is at accurately predicting the positive class. The PR curve can also be used to compare different models. The model with the higher area under the curve (AUC) is generally considered to be the more accurate model."
