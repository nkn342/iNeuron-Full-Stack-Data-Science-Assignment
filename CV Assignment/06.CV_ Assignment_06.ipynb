Generally, more complex data requires more layers, whereas simpler data may require fewer layers. Generally, a range of 1 to 4 hidden layers is recommended, although in some cases more may be necessary."

It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. Normalization usually involves dividing a database table into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined relationships.\n"

These transformations can include rotation, scaling, flips, noise, and a variety of other effects.
